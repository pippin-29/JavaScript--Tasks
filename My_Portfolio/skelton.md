Here's a breakdown of each part:

## ```<!DOCTYPE html>``` 
	This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML. It helps browsers to render the page correctly.

## ```<html lang="en">``` 
	The root element of the HTML document. The lang attribute is used to specify the language of the document (in this case, English).

## ```<head>``` 
	This section contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as character set, viewport settings, and the page title. It also includes links to external stylesheets or scripts.

## ```<meta charset="UTF-8">``` 
	Specifies the character encoding for the document (UTF-8 is commonly used for internationalization).

## ```<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">``` 
	Helps in making the webpage responsive to different screen sizes.

## ```<title>Your Page Title</title>``` 
	Sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser tab.

## ```<body>```
	The main content of the webpage goes here, such as text, images, forms, etc.

    JavaScript code can be included within the <body> section or at the end to ensure that it executes after the HTML content has loaded.

This is a basic template, and you can customize it based on your specific needs by adding more elements or linking to external resources.
